# 📘 StudySnap: Smart Study Companion

**StudySnap** is an iOS native app developed using **SwiftUI**, designed to be a personalized study assistant for students and lifelong learners. The app empowers users to:

- 📄 Capture and manage notes (text and images)
- 🧪 Ask AI questions about their study notes (powered by Groq API)
- 🎓 Automatically generate quizzes based on notes for self-assessment
- 📊 Track learning progress and insights through a modern dashboard

The project emphasizes clean code practices, scalable architecture, and seamless integration with **Firebase** (Authentication + Firestore Database + Cloudinary for image uploads).

## 📁 Project Folder and File Organization

| Folder/File                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Models/**                  | 📄 Define core data models used across the app (e.g., `User`, `Note`, `Quiz`)                                                                 |
| **Services/**                | 🚧 Handle external service interactions (e.g., `FirebaseService` for database/auth, `CloudinaryService` for images, `AIService` for Groq API) |
| **Utilities/**               | 💡 Helper classes and utilities (e.g., `UserDefaultsUtil` for local storage, `NavigationUtil` for centralized navigation management)          |
| **ViewModels/**              | 🔄 Manage state and business logic for each screen following MVVM architecture (e.g., `AuthViewModel`, `NoteViewModel`, `DashboardViewModel`) |
| **Views/**                   | 🔺 SwiftUI View files representing UI components/screens (e.g., `LoginView`, `NoteListView`, `NoteDetailsView`, `DashboardView`)              |
| **AppConstants.swift**       | 📁 Contains shared constants used throughout the app (like colors, config keys).                                                              |
| **Assets/**                  | 🖼️ Resource files like images, colors used in SwiftUI.                                                                                        |
| **GoogleService-Info.plist** | 📄 Firebase configuration file required for Authentication and Firestore services.                                                            |
| **StudySnapApp.swift**       | 📲 Main entry point of the app (`@main`), setting up the root view and injecting environment objects.                                         |
| **.env**                     | 🔑 Securely stores API keys and environment-sensitive data.                                                                                   |

## 🧰 Current Architecture Overview

- 🔄 **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** strictly applied for functional separation.
- 🔍 **EnvironmentObject** pattern for global states like user authentication (`AuthViewModel`).
- 💡 **Loose Coupling and Extensibility**: Services and utilities are decoupled from ViewModels.
- 🔐 **Firebase Integration**: Authentication and Firestore are the backend.
- ☁️ **Cloudinary**: Third-party service for efficient image uploads.
- 💡 **Groq API Integration**: AI services are driven by Groq's LLM for note-based Q&A and quiz generation.
